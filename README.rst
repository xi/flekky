About
=====

Flekky is a static website generator inspired by `Jekyll`_ but written
in python and based on `Flask`_. It is basically a wrapper around the
excellent `Frozen Flask`_ and `Flask FlatPages`_ as described in `this
article`_ by Nicolas Perriault.

So what does it do? It allows you to write templates, assets and
contents for your website and bake all that into static HTML. You can
than deploy that HTML on any webserver and do not have to worry about
anything. `Jinja2`_ is used for templating. `Markdown`_ is used for
creating content.

There are many static website generators out there of which Jekyll is
arguably the most popular. You are probably better of with that. But if
you like Flask and have fun experimenting with things you might give
Flekky a try.

Quickstart
==========

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/xi/flekky.git
    $ cd flekky
    $ virtualenv init env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install
    $ python flekky/flekky.py --source $(pwd)/_example build

Basic Usage
===========

You can generate static HTML by using the ``build`` command::

    $ python flekky.py build

Flekky also comes with a built-in development server that will allow you
to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser
locally::

    $ python flekky.py serve

File structure
==============

A basic Flekky site usually looks like this::

    _source
    ├── pages
    │   ├── index.md
    │   └── test.md
    ├── static
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── style.css
    │   └── js
    └── templates
        ├── base.html
        ├── category.html
        ├── layout
        │   ├── default.html
        │   └── post.html
        └── tag.html

An overview of what each of them does:

-  ``pages``: Your dynamic content, so to speak. These are Markdown
   files, but they also contain some `YAML`_ data at the top.
   ``index.md`` is special because all its metadata is added to ``site``
   , so you can use it to set the title of the complete website.

-  ``static``: Static files like CSS, JavaScript and images.

-  ``templates``: You will probably want to include a ``base.html`` that
   all other templates can extend. ``category.html`` and ``tag.html``
   are used to render category and tag pages respectively. Layouts are
   used to render pages.

Command-line options
====================

Flekky has several command-line options:

-  general

   -  ``--source``: directory where Flekky will read files (default:
      ``_source``)
   -  ``--future``: include pages with dates in the future (default:
      ``false``)
   -  ``--unpublished``: include unpublished pages (default: ``false``)

-  build

   -  ``--destination``: directory where Flekky will write files
      (default: ``_deploy``)

-  serve

   -  ``--port``: port to run at (default: ``8000``)

Variables
=========

Flekky makes a variety of data available to the templating system. The
following is a reference of the available data.

page
----

A page is a Markdown file in the ``pages`` folder. However, at the top
of the file you can (and should) set some meta data using `YAML`_
syntax. All key-value pairs defined here will be available in the
templates. But some fields also have a special meaning:

-  ``title``: Title for this page.

-  ``layout``: Select a template from the ``layout`` folder for
   rendering (default: ``default``).

-  ``published``: Unpublished pages will not be included in the website.
   This can be disabled using the ``--unpublished`` command-line option.

-  ``date``: Pages with dates in the future are not included in the
   website. This can be disabled using the ``--future`` command-line
   option.

-  ``category``: Each page can be filed under a single category. It will
   be included on the category page.

-  ``tags``: Tags can be used to categorize pages. They are very similar
   to categories with the difference that a page can have multiple tags.

site
----

The site object stores all data that applies to the whole project. This
also includes any metadata from ``index.md``.

-  ``title``: Title of the website.

-  ``time``: Current time. This can be used to display the time of the
   last build.

-  ``pages``: A list of all pages.

-  ``categories``: A list of all used categories.

-  ``tags``: A list of all used tags.

-  ``config``: The complete configuration.

Differences from Jekyll
=======================

Flekky aims at being very similar to Jekyll. However it is far from
being a drop-in replacement. Some of the missing features might be added
in the future. For now, these are some of the most important
differences:

-  written in python and based on Flask

-  Markdown only (though it should be easy to extend)

-  slightly different directory structure

   -  no configuration file like ``_config.yml``
   -  ``templates`` instead of ``_includes`` and ``_layouts``
   -  ``pages`` instead of top level files and ``_posts``
   -  no drafts
   -  no data files
   -  date is not encoded in file name
   -  additional files are not copied automatically

-  only pages that are linked to are included in the build

-  no build-in SCSS or CoffeeScript support

-  different (but similar) templating syntax

-  no separators before and after YAML data in page files

-  no build-in pagination

-  no build-in plugin system but the rich Flask ecosystem
